<p>A guest attending a Disney Institute class at Walt Disney World sat down on an outdoor bench during a break.  When he got up, he noticed his pants were soaked.  The sprinklers had just been turned off and the guest did not notice the bench was wet.</p>

<p>Just as he was wondering what to do, a Disney cast member passed by and asked him how his day was going.  He glanced down at his dripping pants and said, "Fine, but don't sit on that bench." </p> 

<p>Instantly the cast member phoned to have a hair dryer delivered and the benches dried.  The cast member then led the guest to a restroom so he could blow-dry his pants before returning to class.</p>

<p>By taking the little extra step, providing that little "wow" our cast member created a positive memory for our guest.</p>
