<p>Exceed the Veterans', families' and visitors' expectations through small service actions. Go the extra step and create little "wows" for them. Meet, and then exceed each Veteran's expectations. They will remember their surprise, brag about it to others, and return for your service again and again.</p>

  <p>On Main Street, USA, I saw a Guest in a Hawaiian shirt approach a Custodial Cast Member. The Guest asked where he could get a cup of ice. The Cast Member directed the Guest to the end of the street where we had an Outdoor Food Cart. The Custodial Cast Member then spoke quickly into a radio. As the Guest walked up to the Cart, the Cast Member at the Cart held out a cup of ice for the Guest. What do you think the Guest said? "Wow!"</p>
