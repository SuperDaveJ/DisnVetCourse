<p>On Main Street, USA, I saw a Guest in a Hawaiian shirt approach a Custodial Cast Member. The Guest asked where he could get a cup of ice. The Cast Member directed the Guest to the end of the street where we had an Outdoor Food Cart. The Custodial Cast Member then spoke quickly into a radio. As the Guest walked up to the Cart, the Cast Member at the Cart held out a cup of ice for the Guest. What do you think the Guest said? "Wow!"</p>
