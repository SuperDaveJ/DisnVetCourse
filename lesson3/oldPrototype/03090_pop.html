<p>The concept <em>everything speaks</em>, as used in this course, originated from Service, Disney Style. The original context of <em>everything speaks</em> refers to Setting. The concept can, however, be applied to every aspect of the service experience.</p> 

<p>The original text from Service, Disney Style follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">In Disney-speak, your setting is wherever your customers meet you. Whether that is a retail store or a hospital or a web site or even a telephone call center, the setting that customers experience plays a critical role in how they perceive their encounter with your organization. The importance of managing the effect of setting on the guest experience can be summed up in two words: <em>Everything speaks</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a quick example from Disney's history. John Hench, one of the original Disney Imagineers (the folks who design and build all of the theme parks), remembers watching Walt Disney finesse a setting:</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">I was so astonished by the way Walt would create a kind of live-action cross-dissolve when passing from one area of Disneyland to another. He would even insist on changing the texture of the pavement at the threshold of each new land because, he said, 'You can get information about a changing environment through the soles of your feet.</p>

<p>At the Walt Disney World Resort, <em>everything speaks</em> means that every detail from the doorknobs to the dining rooms sends a message to guests. The message being sent must be consistent with the service theme and standards, and must support and further the show being created. And, the next time you are in the Magic Kingdom, have some fun and pay attention to what your feet sense as you walk from one themed area to the next.</p>
