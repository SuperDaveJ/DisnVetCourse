<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">I had Coast Guard parents. I had five Army foster parents. I had a Navy and two Marine Corps foster families.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Mike Meinen</p> 
<p class="cc">The attack that I got injured in was outside Fallujah on August 25, 2003. I was one of the first amputees from the war.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Joan Cole</p> 
<p class="cc">I was not aware when I got out of the service that I was eligible to be a patient at the VA hospitals. I was not wounded in service. I had no service disabilities connected to that.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">I wanted to go into the Navy and become a Corps Wave. I was really excited about that because I wanted to become a nurse.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Kriss Natividad</p> 
<p class="cc">I was a Gunner on a HumVee. I got deployed out to Iraq for in the first invasion in 2003 as an infantry military police company.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">I had become so enclosed, so cut off from the world, because as my vision closed in, my entire world did.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Kriss Natividad</p> 
<p class="cc">I came home and started drinking heavily from the PTSD I guess it is. I came home and started driving and was in an accident. They couldn't save my leg; they had to amputate it.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Mike Meinen</p> 
<p class="cc">I was really kind of a grumpy cuss. I just got really tired of hearing from the doctors and nurses that I was going to be fine.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">From the moment I arrived, people met me, talked to me, explained what was going on. The most patient staff, the most patient people who said, "I may not be in your shoes, but I'm going to help you get through this, and I'm going to walk with you as you do it." And that's exactly what they do.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Javeriah Haleem</p> 
<p class="cc">When they give their lives, they give their limbs, they give their, a piece of themselves to our freedom. It's very important that we focus on all of their needs, not just patch them up and make them look pretty again, but to really take care of everything.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Shaun Rudh</p> 
<p class="cc">Don't worry about what conditions you had. Don't tell us about "Well, I don't think I can do this because..." I'm like, literally, what do you want to do, and we'll try to find a way to make it happen.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">Whatever I needed, they made it happen and make it so for me. You know what? I am worthy of being here. I'm worthy of still being alive and I had lost that. I didn't really have a lot of hope. I don't know how else to put it, but I learned hope at this clinic.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Kriss Natividad</p> 
<p class="cc">What am I going to do now? I can't run, I can't, and the nurses, you know, they would tell me that there's legs that you can do all of this stuff, you know. You've just got to take time and I wanted it now, now. </p>

<p class="ccTitle">David Van Sleet</p> 
<p class="cc">Our mission for this new generation of Veterans, it's, you know, we're offering Veteran Centered type of care for them.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Georg Alexander Hishaw</p> 
<p class="cc">The great thing about working at the VA is that every individual, every Veteran has their own story. And so often, the VA allows me the opportunity to explore that with the person and get a better understanding of them and their experiences over their lifetime.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Javeriah Haleem</p> 
<p class="cc">A lot of times, you have to stop and you have to take in what they're saying and just an extra word of kindness, an extra, a moment for them to say what's on their mind.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Joan Cole</p> 
<p class="cc">In a very, very anxious moment of depression, I went to the women's clinic and really didn't know whether or not I wanted to go on. A cup of coffee and a genuine, personal interest. If this had been family, it could not have been a more understanding situation that went on to guide me in a direction. But that decision, at that moment, probably saved my life.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Shaun Rudh</p> 
<p class="cc">All it takes is for you to have that one special moment with somebody where you see that you really are doing something for them.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">The whole team has just changed my life, and they've opened the world back up to me. My being here today, there's no way this would have happened if they hadn't reached out and said, "I know you can do it." And not only did they say it, they convinced me.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Georg Alexander Hishaw</p> 
<p class="cc">These are people that have put themselves out on the line and that have done a lot for our country. Days that I get to work at the VA and to work with the Veterans is really my chance to be able to say, "Thank you."</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Mike Meinen</p> 
<p class="cc">Not only am I a patient at the VA, I'm now the Chief of Prosthetics at the Amarillo VA, so I can continue to pay this forward and take these guys and gals underneath my wing. They come down to the Prosthetics office and I'm sitting down there and they have somebody that they can relate to right away.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">David Van Sleet</p> 
<p class="cc">The reason I work for the VA is because I'm a service-affected Veteran myself and it was time for me to give something back after I received a lot of care through the VA medical care system.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Mike Meinen</p> 
<p class="cc">It gives me a big grin. Just makes me feel good knowing that I'm doing the right thing.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Shaun Rudh</p> 
<p class="cc">Just makes you feel good and makes you feel like "I'm doing something good here… part of something bigger." </p>

<p class="ccTitle">Georg Alexander Hishaw</p> 
<p class="cc">I'm Georg Alexander Hishaw, and I'm proud to be able to serve the Veterans that have served our country.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Javeriah Haleem</p> 
<p class="cc">My name is Javeriah Haleem, and I'm a Staff Dentist at the Albuquerque VA hospital, and I make Veterans smile again.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Shaun Rudh</p> 
<p class="cc">My name is Shaun Rudh and I'm proud to know that I'm making a difference with Veterans.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Kriss Natividad</p> 
<p class="cc">I'd like to tell all of the VA staff out there to keep doing what you're doing. You may not realize it, but it does help. It changed my life. </p>

<p class="ccTitle">Jhenni Morrow</p> 
<p class="cc">Thank you for respecting me. When you respect yourself and pass that respect on, it means more than anyone's ever going to tell you. It means more than you'll ever hear, but believe me, it is felt and it is appreciated.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Mike Meinen</p> 
<p class="cc">For those of you who have helped me out, both as a patient and professionally, thank you for giving me a chance to get my life back.</p>

<p class="ccTitle">Joan Cole</p> 
<p class="cc">To all of the personnel, whatever the level of your profession is, you do it with grace and goodwill and there is no way you have served those of us who have served in our country, you have served us in many ways far better than we have served you. Thank you.</p>
